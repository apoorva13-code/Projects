freeCodeCamp is a nonprofit organization that provides free coding lessons and resources to help people learn programming and software development skills. 
As a business data analyst, I'm new to the coding and software side. While I have experience with analytical tools and some knowledge of Python, I'm expanding my skill set through self-learning to explore this new field.

I began with small steps and am excited to start building interesting projects. Here's my first web design project using HTML.

âœ¨Fun fact: While many people learn HTML in school or during their undergrad, coming from a mechanical engineering background (now working in IT), this is still new to me!
